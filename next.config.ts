// for every thumbnail. Only images from THIS project's public storage may be
// optimized (the optimizer fetches whatever it is pointed at, so it is
// restricted to the one place we upload to).

// for this shop (there is no user-written HTML anywhere; JSON-LD is escaped).
// Everything else below is strict. Production only: the dev server needs eval
